Learned the fundamentals of ReactJS by building an interactive flashcard app that tells the story of React and its role in the industry.

- Setup a new project using React, ReactDOM and Babel and began working with the building blocks of React web applications: components.
- Used props to make components reusable and began using ES6 class components.
- Mastered ES6 concepts like const, let, and arrow functions and used the React Developer Tools to understand how the application worked at a deep level.
- Worked with the state of the application and allowed the application to react to user interactions.
